// This file will need to create and return the div that holds all the DOM stuff for a To Do item when you full screen it. Right now To Dos just
// show the title and date. When you click on whatever that makes the To Do show you more it will need this class to pop up.

// When you close the to do it should go back to the previous display. Maybe pass something into a function so that when you close the To Do
// it just goes back the list. Like it calls the function that displays the list and stuff
